## ⚠️ Remaining Tasks (Server-Side Setup)

### A. One-Time Server Setup (You must do these on the droplet)

1. **Backup Existing System**:
   ```bash
   # Take DigitalOcean snapshot
   # Perform logical database backup
   pg_dump -h localhost -U lto_user -d lto_blockchain > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```

2. **Update Code on Droplet**:
   ```bash
   # Pull latest code or upload updated files
   git pull origin main  # or upload via SCP
   ```

3. **Initialize PostgreSQL** (if starting fresh):
   ```bash
   # Connect to PostgreSQL container
   docker exec -it postgres psql -U lto_user -d lto_blockchain
   
   # Run schema
   \i database/all\ schema.sql
   ```

4. **Start Fabric Network**:
   ```bash
   # Use ONLY docker-compose.unified.yml (3 orgs: LTO, HPG, Insurance).
   # Do NOT use docker-compose.fabric.yml — it is legacy and includes Emission org + wrong topology.
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d
   
   # Wait for services to be healthy
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml ps
   ```

5. **Generate Crypto Material** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   # Generate crypto-config for 3 organizations
   # This requires cryptogen or Fabric CA setup
   # See IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md Phase 1 for details
   ```

6. **Create Channel and Install Chaincode**:
   ```bash
   # Create channel with 3 orgs
   # Install chaincode on all 3 peers
   # Approve and commit with endorsement policy: AND('LTOMSP.peer', OR('HPGMSP.peer', 'InsuranceMSP.peer'))
   ```

7. **Enroll CA Admins and Backend Signers**:
   ```bash
   # Run CA enrollment scripts
   node scripts/fabric-ca/enroll-backend-signers.js
   
   # Verify identities in wallet
   ls wallet/
   ```

8. **Seed System Accounts**:
   ```sql
   -- Insert required accounts in PostgreSQL
   INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, role, organization, is_active, email_verified)
   VALUES 
     ('admin@lto.gov.ph', '$2b$12$...', 'LTO', 'Admin', 'admin', 'LTO', true, true),
     ('hpg@hpg.gov.ph', '$2b$12$...', 'HPG', 'Admin', 'admin', 'HPG', true, true),
     ('insurance@hpg.gov.ph', '$2b$12$...', 'Insurance', 'Verifier', 'insurance_verifier', 'Insurance', true, true),
     ('certificategenerator@generator.com', '$2b$12$...', 'Certificate', 'Generator', 'admin', 'System', true, true);
   ```

9. **Seed Pre-Minted Vehicles** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Use admin route or direct chaincode call to mint vehicles
   # See IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md Phase 3.0 for details
   ```

10. **Start Application**:
    ```bash
    # Application should auto-start via docker-compose
    # Check logs
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml logs -f lto-app
    ```

## ✅ Code status vs IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES / IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| **docker-compose** | ✅ | Only `docker-compose.unified.yml` is used for deployment (3 orgs: LTO, HPG, Insurance). App error message points to `docker-compose.unified.yml`. |
| **config/crypto-config.yaml** | ✅ | Defines LTO, HPG, Insurance (no Emission). |
| **config/configtx.yaml** | ✅ | LTOMSP, HPGMSP, InsuranceMSP; Channel profile for `ltochannel`. |
| **network-config.json** | ✅ | Multi-org peers, CAs, channel `ltochannel`. |
| **Chaincode** | ✅ | `UpdateVerificationStatus`: `hpg` (emission removed); MintVehicle, AttachOwnerToMintedVehicle, UpdateCertificateHash, GetCertificateHash. |
| **optimizedFabricService.js** | ✅ | `getFabricIdentityForUser()`, user context in `initialize()`, mint/attach/certificate methods. |
| **Routes (lto, transfer, hpg, insurance, vehicles, admin, certificates, issuer)** | ✅ | User context passed to `fabricService.initialize()` where required. |
| **blockchain.js** | ✅ | Fabric init failure message says `docker-compose.unified.yml`; no fallback. |
| **setup-fabric-wallet.js** | ✅ | Puts `admin` and `admin-lto` from LTO Admin cert. |
| **Scripts** | ✅ | `unified-setup.sh`, `complete-fabric-reset-reconfigure.sh`, and fix scripts use `docker-compose.unified.yml` for up/restart. |
| **Emission references** | ⚠️ Legacy | DB columns, verifier-dashboard, admin.js transfer fields, and some UI labels still mention "emission"; documented as deprecated. Chaincode and verification model are LTO + HPG + Insurance only. |

## 📟 Exact SSH commands to run (copy-paste)

**Assumption:** You are on the droplet (or `ssh root@<your-droplet-ip>`). Project path: `~/LTOBLOCKCHAIN` (adjust if different).

### Path A — Fresh server or OK to lose existing volumes (recommended first-time)

This runs the full unified setup: cleanup, crypto, channel, chaincode, wallet. **Warning:** `unified-setup.sh` runs `down -v` first, so **Postgres and other volumes are removed**. Backup DB first if you need to keep data.

```bash
cd ~/LTOBLOCKCHAIN

# Optional: backup Postgres first (if you need to keep data)
docker exec postgres pg_dump -U lto_user -d lto_blockchain > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql 2>/dev/null || true

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Full setup (crypto + channel + chaincode + wallet). Destroys existing volumes.
chmod +x scripts/unified-setup.sh
./scripts/unified-setup.sh

# Rebuild and start app so it uses latest code
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d --build lto-app

# Check app logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml logs -f lto-app
```

If Postgres was recreated, load schema and seed users (see step 3 and 8 in "One-Time Server Setup" above).

---

### Path B — Keep existing Postgres/data (crypto and channel already exist or you will create them manually)

Use this if the stack is already running and you only need to fix channel/wallet or refresh the app.

```bash
cd ~/LTOBLOCKCHAIN

# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Stop legacy Fabric stack if it was ever started (avoids port/conflict)
docker compose -f docker-compose.fabric.yml down -v 2>/dev/null || true

# 3. Start unified stack only (no volume removal)
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d

# 4. Wait for services (orderer, peers, couchdb, postgres)
sleep 25
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml ps

# 5. If channel not created yet: run full unified-setup (WARNING: removes volumes) OR
#    run scripts/complete-fabric-reset-reconfigure.sh (also does down -v).
#    If crypto and channel already exist, skip to step 6.

# 6. Wallet (LTO admin identity for app)
node scripts/setup-fabric-wallet.js

# 7. Rebuild and start app
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d --build lto-app

# 8. Check logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml logs -f lto-app
```

If you get **"access denied"** after this, the channel `ltochannel` is still missing or the identity is not in the channel: run **Path A** (full `./scripts/unified-setup.sh`) on a copy/test server, or create the channel and join peers manually (see IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md Phase 1 / script Phase 5–7).

## 🔧 502 and "access denied" troubleshooting

**Why you see 502 in the browser**

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | Nginx proxies requests to `lto-app`. |
| 2 | `lto-app` starts and runs Fabric init (`optimizedFabricService.initialize()` with identity `admin`). |
| 3 | Fabric SDK does **service discovery** on channel `ltochannel`. |
| 4 | Peers respond with **"access denied"** → init throws → `backend/routes/blockchain.js` catches and calls **`process.exit(1)`**. |
| 5 | Container exits → Nginx gets no backend → **502 Bad Gateway**. |

**Why "access denied" happens**

- **Channel `ltochannel` does not exist yet** (most common), or
- The wallet identity (`admin` / `admin-lto`) is not in the channel (e.g. channel was created with different orgs/MSPs), or
- Crypto or MSP mismatch (wrong cert for LTOMSP).

**Fix on the server (in order)**

1. **Use only the unified stack:**  
   `docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d`  
   (Do **not** use `docker-compose.fabric.yml`.)

2. **Create channel and join peers:**  
   Run the full Fabric setup so `ltochannel` exists and all three peers have joined:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/unified-setup.sh
   ```
   Or follow `scripts/complete-fabric-reset-reconfigure.sh` (generate configtx, create channel, join LTO/HPG/Insurance peers, install and commit chaincode).

3. **Ensure wallet has LTO admin:**  
   After crypto is generated, run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-fabric-wallet.js
   ```
   This populates `wallet/` with `admin` and `admin-lto` from `fabric-network/crypto-config/.../Admin@lto.gov.ph`.

4. **Deploy latest code** so the app’s error message says `docker-compose.unified.yml` (and so any other fixes are present):
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d --build lto-app
   ```

**Browser message:** `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed...` is usually from a **browser extension** (e.g. password manager, ad blocker), not from your app. You can ignore it or test in an incognito window with extensions disabled.

## 🔍 Critical Verification Points

### Fabric as Source of Truth ✅
- **Vehicle Registration**: All vehicle registrations are recorded on Fabric via `RegisterVehicle` chaincode
- **Transfer of Ownership**: All transfers are recorded on Fabric via `TransferOwnership` chaincode
- **Verification Status**: All verifications (HPG, Insurance, Admin) are recorded on Fabric via `UpdateVerificationStatus`
- **Certificate Hashes**: All OR/CR certificate PDF hashes are stored on Fabric via `UpdateCertificateHash`
- **Pre-Minted Vehicles**: CSR-verified vehicles exist on Fabric via `MintVehicle` before owner attachment

### PostgreSQL as Derived Index/Cache ✅
- PostgreSQL stores vehicle data for fast queries and UI display
- PostgreSQL stores document metadata and IPFS CIDs
- PostgreSQL stores user accounts and application-level RBAC
- **Critical**: All authoritative business state (vehicle ownership, status, verifications) comes from Fabric

### Multi-Org Authorization ✅
- **LTO-only writes**: `RegisterVehicle`, `TransferOwnership`, `MintVehicle`, `AttachOwnerToMintedVehicle`, `UpdateCertificateHash`
- **HPG-only verification**: Only HPGMSP can set `hpg` verification status
- **Insurance-only verification**: Only InsuranceMSP can set `insurance` verification status
- **LTO-only admin verification**: Only LTOMSP can set `admin` verification status
- **Endorsement policy**: `AND('LTOMSP.peer', OR('HPGMSP.peer', 'InsuranceMSP.peer'))` - requires LTO + at least one external org

---

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

1. ✅ Fabric network is running (3 peers, 3 CAs, 1 orderer)
2. ✅ Wallet contains identities: `admin`, `admin-lto`, `admin-hpg`, `admin-insurance`
3. ✅ Channel created with 3 organizations
4. ✅ Chaincode installed and committed with correct endorsement policy
5. ✅ System accounts exist in PostgreSQL
6. ✅ Vehicle registration writes to Fabric
7. ✅ Transfer of ownership writes to Fabric
8. ✅ HPG verification writes to Fabric (using HPGMSP identity)
9. ✅ Insurance verification writes to Fabric (using InsuranceMSP identity)
10. ✅ Certificate hash storage writes to Fabric

## 📝 Notes

- **Fabric is the authoritative source**: All critical business transactions are recorded on Fabric
- **PostgreSQL is derived**: Used for fast queries, UI display, and application data
- **Dynamic identity selection**: Backend automatically selects correct Fabric identity based on user role
- **No vehicle_owner Fabric identities**: Public users have functional control only, no cryptographic authority
- **Pre-minted vehicles**: Support CSR-verified, ownerless vehicles on-chain before owner attachment
